Welcome to the home page of OpenHA in github.

This project is initially launched by the Reliable Flight Control Group (rfly) of Beihang University, and the tentative idea of OpenHA could trace back to the year of 2019, just before the breakout of COVID-19 epidemic.

In the past years, we have done a lot of work to get us prepared to launch this long-term project.

We think it's finally the times now.

This project is being developed right now and it's expected to be officially released before July.

Please contact us if you are interested in it and want to join to make contributions.

Documents are avaliable in [this repository](https://rfly-openha.github.io/documents/) (not finished yet ðŸ˜‚).

More information about rfly in avaliable on our [official website](http://rfly.buaa.edu.cn).
