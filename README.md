Welcome to the home page of OpenHA in GitHub.

This project is initially launched by the Reliable Flight Control Group (rfly) of Beihang University, and the tentative idea of OpenHA could trace back to the year 2019, just before the breakout of the COVID-19 epidemic.

In the past years, we have done a lot of work to get prepared to launch this long-term project.

We have done some relative projects, conducted in-depth research, and published some scientific papers.

In a word, our team is growing all the time.

It's time now.

This project is being developed right now and it's expected to be officially released before July.

Please contact us if you are also interested in it and would like to join us to make your contributions.

Documents are available in [this repository](https://rfly-openha.github.io/documents/) (not finished yet ðŸ˜‚).

More information about rfly is available on our [official website](http://rfly.buaa.edu.cn).
